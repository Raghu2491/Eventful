##Summary of Functions
####The application, based on the user's location displays the evets from eventful api. The user can filter the events based on the many categories provided by Eventful api.
####The user can also get the location of the event using google maps. Further more, the user can create an event and check who is attending the event. The system runs a service that clears all the experied events from the firebase data store. Only the user who created the event and the system (if the event has experied) can delete that event.
####The application provides a fine grained security using the Firebase security feature. I have built all the functionality all that is left now is to complete is appealing user interface.
